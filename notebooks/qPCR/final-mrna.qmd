This file is for creating final plots. Curated from the mRNA.qmd file. 

All data manipulation was done before the start of this quarto manuscript project. Code is in: C:/Users/alosvendsen/OneDrive - Syddansk Universitet/PhD/R_code/manuscript_1 And copied to this project: /notebooks/qPCR/old_qPCR_import

Donor 1: timepoints = 72 and 120 hours Donor 2: timepoints = 24, 72, and 120 hours Donor 2: timepoints = 24, 72, and 120 hours

## Setup

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(here)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
library(RColorBrewer)
source(here("notebooks/qPCR/custom_functions.R"))
```

## Finalize the data and save the data table

### Load data, remove 0.001 ng/ml cytokine concentrations, calculate means for each experiment.
Already done. Commented out. Final plot data i ./data_final_for_plotting/
```{r}
#### Load data, filter data and calculate geometric means
# data <- readRDS(here("notebooks/qPCR/data_processed/final_dataframe.rds"))
# 
# # Remove the lowest concentrations of cytokines, since not used in all 
# # Experiments. Note 24 hour time points was only used in one experiment
# plot_data <- data[!treatment %chin% c("0.001 ng/ml IL-1B", "0.001 ng/ml IL-6")]
# 
# 
# # Calculate the mean expression grouped by experiment, condition, treatment, and time. USE GEOMETRIC MEAN when averaging normalized expression (RQ) values, since they are on a multiplicative scale. 
# plot_data[,
#           bio_group_mean_expression := geometric_mean(normalized_expression),
#           by = .(experiment, condition, treatment, time, target)
#           ]
# 
# # Save the data
# saveRDS(plot_data, here("notebooks/qPCR/data_final_for_plotting/plot_data.rds"))
```

```{r}
# rmv <- ls()[!grepl(x =ls(), pattern = "geometric")]
# 
# rm(list = rmv)
```

## Plots and downregulation data
Load the plot data-

```{r}
plot_data <- readRDS(here("notebooks/qPCR/data_final_for_plotting/plot_data.rds"))
```

### Main plot CYP3A4 expression after IL-6 and IL-1B

Subset data and get time means

```{r}
# Subset for 3A4
data_3A4 <- plot_data[treatment != "0.0001% BSA" & target == "CYP3A4"]

# Get means of all time points
data_3A4[,
         time_means := geometric_mean(bio_group_mean_expression),
         by = .(condition, treatment, time)]


overall_means <-
  data_3A4[,
           .(overall_mean = mean(time_means)),
           by = .(condition, treatment)
           ]

# data_3A4[]
